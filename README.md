# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Python-Console
A simple Tic Tac Toe game using the console text interface

This is a simple project to demonstrate my understanding of Python and its syntax:
  + Loops
  + If statements
  + Bug fixing invalid inputs, paths, and infinite loop conditions.
  + input() methods and manipulating them.
